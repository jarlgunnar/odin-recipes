    <h2>Description of Deep Fried Oreos</h2>
        <p>
            A deep-fried Oreo is a dessert or snack consisting of a chocolate sandwich 
            cookie which is dipped in batter and deep fried. It may be served with 
            different toppings, most commonly powdered sugar. Deep-fried Oreos are 
            generally made using Oreo-brand cookies, hence the name, but other chocolate 
            sandwich cookies can be used.

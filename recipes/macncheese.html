    <strong>Description of Macaroni and Cheese Recipe</strong>
        <p>
            Macaroni and cheese (also called mac and cheese in Canada and the United States and macaroni 
            cheese in the United Kingdom) is a dish of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most
            commonly cheddar sauce.

        <p>
            The traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; 
            however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. The 
            cheese is often first incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is 
            then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food.
